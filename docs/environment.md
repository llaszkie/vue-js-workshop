# Environment

First, let's define our environment so that we are all on the same page.

**You will be needing**
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version > 8.\* (I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), the Node Version Manager, to install Node.js so that you can easily switch between multiple versions - Linux/OSx only tool)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - a package manager for Node.js
* Your web editor of choice, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great pick for front-end development. Install it among with following extensions:
   * [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) 
   * [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur)
* A competent web browser e.g. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.se/chrome/browser/desktop/)
   * enhanced with [Vue devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools)

**Save some time**
* To speed up the things during workshop, it is recommended that you pre-fetch all required projects dependencies
* To do that, execute **yarn** command in each exercise directory that contains _package.json_ file
